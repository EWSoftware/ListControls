# EWSoftware.ListControls Library
The EWSoftware List Controls Library is a set of extended .NET Windows Forms list controls.  The controls
include an auto-complete combo box, a multi-column combo box, a user control drop-down combo box, a radio button
list, a check box list, a data navigator control, and a data list control (similar in nature to a continuous
details section in Microsoft Access, the **DataList** web server control, or the **DataRepeater** from VB6).

The controls support various data source types just like other .NET controls such as the standard combo box
(data sets, data views, data tables, array lists or any other collection object that implement the `IList`
interface, and simple strings).  All fields in the data sources are accessible via indexers and all controls
provide design-time support for defining formatting, layout, data source, and many other control properties.
